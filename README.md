# CS-408-final-project

## Project Specifications

This project is going to be book-keeping end to end application. Users can add a book into the inventory and edit it and also put a review on it. They will able be able to search among the books in inventory and see it's description and reviews people have left on it. This project will incorporate all the learning in this course from accessibility to creating api endpoints on AWS lambda and interactive frontend.

The target audience is people who loves/likes to read. It's intended for them to search for new books by seeing their reviews stars and what other people have to say for it.

The data I plan to store for each book is very simple. It will be of very basic types. Even the images of cover of book will be a url of the image on the internet. I am not planning to deep down to build everything but enough to make it interesting with the learnings I have gotten from this course.

There could possibility of alot of stretch goals. Could make it some sort of book reviews social media like app where normal users come to look for their new book and check this app to find one.
